# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm dan (redicides), an incompetent and so called "full stack" dev. 

I build many things, some which are cool, and some which are straight up pieces of shit with no proper use.

I usually develop using the following tools, languages, and databases... as well as some services to deploy to the cloud.
