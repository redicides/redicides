# 👋 Hey there!

I'm **dan** — a biochemistry student who also happens to enjoy playing with code (and occasionally breaking things for fun).

In my spare time, you'll usually find me building just about anything, but I usually build discord user installable applications. It's not anything special, but I find neat. Most of my work stays private, so don't expect a treasure trove of open-source projects here.

As for contributing to others' projects... let's just say I'm more of a lone wolf in that department (for now).

### ✉️ Contact

My username on all platforms tends to be `@redicides`, but I'm mostly active on Discord.
If you (for whatever reason) decide to contact me, please be direct about it.

If you don't have Discord (understandable), feel free to send me an email at `contact@redicies.me`!

## 🧰 Tech Stack

I tend to use these tools (or languages) whenever I (try to) make something decent.
I don't have the broadest stack, but it works for me.
