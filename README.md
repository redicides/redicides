# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm dan (redicides), an incompetent and so called "full stack" dev. 

I build many things, some which are cool, and some which are straight up pieces of shit with no proper use.

## Tech Stack

I usually use the following languages, frameworks, databases, and tools, for my bs.

If you couldn't already tell, I stick to easy & interpreted languages, with Go being an exception.
